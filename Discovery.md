## Request Baskets 

Deta Space Port of https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets

[Request Baskets](https://rbaskets.in) is a web service to collect arbitrary HTTP requests and inspect them via RESTful API or simple web UI.

It is strongly inspired by ideas and application design of the [RequestHub](https://github.com/kyledayton/requesthub) project and reproduces functionality offered by [RequestBin](http://requestb.in/) service.
